# TODO:
* Add image uploading feature to log book. Display them in a modal. Maybe use Python to base64 encode the images for display in an img tag?
* Find out how to make Plot.ly work with React. Things broke when I tried initially. Worst case scenario we have non real-time and non interactive plots generated with R or Python :(
* Once Plot.ly is figured out Python script to analyze Arduino power data can be written
* Add a document storage and search section for things like surveys and other files
